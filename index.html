                    Zhongli is a character from the popular mobile game that almost everyone knows of thanks to the
                    repeatitive 'emergency food' ads on Youtube. Yes, I am talking about Genshin Impact, my new
                    obsession. And Zhongli, aka, <dfn>Morax</dfn>, aka <dfn><abbr title="Geo Archon">Rex
                            Lapis</abbr></dfn>, is my latest 2D crush.

            <summary class="Title" id="Title1">Introduction</summary>

            <p> Zhongli is a consultant in Wanshen Funeral Parlour in Liyue. He mysteriously has a vast amount of
                knowledge about in and outside of Liyue, earning him the name 'The Walking Encyclopedia' from some. He
                also loves to share the knowledge with the people around him, which makes our dear 'grandpa' quite
                talkative.</p>

                  <!--Need to use the tag <aside> before the paragraph-->
            <aside id="right-aside">
                <p>According to Paimon, even though Zhongli has knowledge about pretty much everything, he likes to
                    discuss about petty things. To which he responded that it's because he wants to share the fun things
                    with us. How cute!</p>
            </aside>

            <p>He is often seen at the wine shop, listening to the stories of ancient Liyue by the storyteller Tian.
                Because of his expertise in various things, he is well respected by most people in the Liyue (except
                Paimon and the traveller, I suppose :) ).
            </p>

            <aside id="left-aside">
                <p>"You almost make it sound like I'm some sort of...bourgeois parasite, whose only utility lies in
                    providing quaint pieces of trivia on demand." - Zhongli to Paimon</p>
            </aside>
            <p>
                After the the events in Rite of descesion and the quests to find the adepti, the traveller is introduced
                to Zhongli through Childe. Thus begins the quest to hold the Rite of Parting along with him.</p>

            <p>**Contains potential spoiler** <br>Ran from Monstadt to Liyue as if running in a marathon, just to find
                Rex Lapis dead.<br>Made me a bit dead inside as well :)

            <summary class="Title" id="Title2">Appearance</summary>
            <p>
            <aside><i>I have neither time nor desire to make detailed analysis of his clothes and skin color and stuffs,
                    so I just copy-pasted this section from <a
                        href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Zhongli/Lore#Appearance" target="_blank">Genshin
                        Impact Wiki</a> in order to increase the content :') </i></aside>
            </p>

            <p> Zhongli currently appears as a tall man with fair skin and a stern expression. His eyes are bright and
                sharp, amber in color with glowing yellow pupils set in the shape of diamonds. He wears red eyeliner on
                the lower lids of his eyes. When using Geo, his eyes become luminescent. His dark brown hair is styled
                in a windswept fashion with a longer fringe that hangs from the right side of his face. It fades to
                amber brown at the tips and is pulled back in a long ponytail that falls beyond his waist.
                <img id="appearance" src="Images/Appearance.png">
                When he is using his Geo abilities, his amber highlights glow. This appearance is also used in The
                Statues of The Seven's depiction of Rex Lapis around Liyue.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                His attire is elegant and form-fitting, consisting of a beige dress shirt, a brown and amber waistcoat,
                slim black trousers, black dress boots, and black gloves with twin silver archer rings on the thumbs.
                His neckpiece is a white tie pinned at the throat by an amber gemstone. His left ear is adorned with a
                jeweled tassel earring. Over everything, he wears a long dark brown tailcoat with dragon scale patterns,
                gold and silver accents, golden tassels, and Rex Lapis' diamond symbol on the back. Zhongli's clothes
                are decorated with diamond symbols found on his sleeves, belt, trousers, waistcoat buttons, and tailcoat
                buttons. Similarly to Venti, because he was an Archon with an innate Gnosis, the "Vision" embedded on
                his chain at the small of his back is nothing more than a fake.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Previously, he appeared as a brown and amber Chinese dragon/qilin with gold accents known as the Exuvia.
                His outfit, Hermit of Mortal Life, is described to be his leisurewear of choice as the consultant of the
                Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.<br><br><br>

                poverty?</summary>


            <p>
                If you go out for shopping with Zhongli, these are what you will face: </p>
            <figure class="rightPic"><img src="Images/A Shame.jpg" id="zhongli2"></figure>
            <p>
                He would order the whole stock of the item you are supposed to buy. ALL OF THEM. No bargaining, no
                second thoughts. When the happy shopkeeper is packing the the goods, you'd be wondering how rich this
                man is, or, just how poor you are, only to find him turn to you, and saying, "Do you...have any mora on
                you? I forgot to bring any"

                <br><br><br>And the cycle goes on.<br><br> It is always Childe who comes and saves the day by providing
                all the financial support for Zhongli. According to him,our delusional grandpa cannot imagine himself
                being poor, hence he is never concerned about mora, although he almost never has any mora with him
                either.
            </p><br><br>

            </figure>

            Ironically, the name of the currency, Mora, is derived from the Geo Archon's name, Morax. Which makes it
            even funnier as to how moraless Morax is in the mortal realm.<br><br> <i>At the end of the journey, he explains to the traveller why he is so broke all the
                time *Cute >w<*. Then he was like, "We only spent Fatui money so it wasn't that bad of a deed" *Sheeesh
                    XD* </i>

                Here is the most famous quote of this ancient archon, which unfortunately has also become a meme material. (An unnecessary addition to this article, but I just want to use audio tag heh)

            <p>
                After hanging out with him for all this time, I have realized that instead of crushing on the pretty face of this pretty boy (like I
                have been doing since before even starting playing the game), I feel kind of respectful(?) towards this
                old man now. Whatever the case is, it is really fun being with him. As the Ferrylady said, "Once you
                become entagled with Mr.Zhongli, there's no getting away from him at all", I really am now thinking of
                being stuck in Liyue for a while more.
