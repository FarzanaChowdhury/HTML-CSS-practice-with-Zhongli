     Zhongli is a character from the popular mobile game that almost everyone knows of thanks to the repeatitive 'emergency food' ads on Youtube. Yes, I am talking about Genshin Impact, my new obsession. And Zhongli, aka, <dfn>Morax</dfn>, aka <dfn><abbr title="Geo Archon">Rex Lapis</abbr></dfn>, is my latest 2D crush.</p><br><br><br>

   <!--Need to use the tag <aside> before the paragraph-->

         <details><summary class="Title" id="Title1">Introduction</summary>
            
   <p> Zhongli is a consultant in Wanshen Funeral Parlour in Liyue. He mysteriously has a vast amount of knowledge about in and outside of Liyue, earning him the name 'The Walking Encyclopedia' from some. He also loves to share the knowledge with the people around him, which makes our dear 'grandpa' quite talkative.</p>
    <aside id="right"><p>According to Paimon, even though Zhongli has knowledge about pretty much everything, he likes to discuss about petty things. To which he responded that it's because he wants to share the fun things with us. How cute!</p> </aside>

    <p>He is often seen at the wine shop, listening to the stories of ancient Liyue by the storyteller Tian.  Because of his expertise in various things, he is well respected by most people in the Liyue (except Paimon and the traveller, I suppose :) ).
    </p>
    
    <aside id="left"><p>"You almost make it sound like I'm some sort of...bourgeois parasite, whose only utility lies in providing quaint pieces of trivia on demand." - Zhongli to Paimon</p></aside>
    <p> 
    After the the events in Rite of descesion and the quests to find the adepti, the traveller is introduced to Zhongli through Childe. Thus begins the quest to hold the Rite of Parting along with him.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    
    <h4>Personal Experience:</h4>
    <p>**Contains potential spoiler** <br>Ran from Monstad to Liyue as if running in a marathon, just to find Rex Lapis dead.<br>Made me a bit dead inside as well :)<figure class="centerPic"><img src="Images/selfie.png" class ="Pic"><figcaption>Posing after finally being able to meet Zhongli</figcaption></p>

    <details><summary class="Title" id="Title2">Appearance</summary> 
<p>
<aside><i>I have neither time nor desire to make detailed analysis of his clothes and skin color and stuffs, so I just copy-pasted this section from <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Zhongli/Lore#Appearance">Genshin Impact Wiki</a> in order to increase the content :') </i></aside>
    
    Zhongli currently appears as a tall man with fair skin and a stern expression. His eyes are bright and sharp, amber in color with glowing yellow pupils set in the shape of diamonds. He wears red eyeliner on the lower lids of his eyes. When using Geo, his eyes become luminescent. His dark brown hair is styled in a windswept fashion with a longer fringe that hangs from the right side of his face. It fades to amber brown at the tips and is pulled back in a long ponytail that falls beyond his waist. When he is using his Geo abilities, his amber highlights glow. This appearance is also used in The Statues of The Seven's depiction of Rex Lapis around Liyue.
<br><br>
    His attire is elegant and form-fitting, consisting of a beige dress shirt, a brown and amber waistcoat, slim black trousers, black dress boots, and black gloves with twin silver archer rings on the thumbs. His neckpiece is a white tie pinned at the throat by an amber gemstone. His left ear is adorned with a jeweled tassel earring. Over everything, he wears a long dark brown tailcoat with dragon scale patterns, gold and silver accents, golden tassels, and Rex Lapis' diamond symbol on the back. Zhongli's clothes are decorated with diamond symbols found on his sleeves, belt, trousers, waistcoat buttons, and tailcoat buttons. Similarly to Venti, because he was an Archon with an innate Gnosis, the "Vision" embedded on his chain at the small of his back is nothing more than a fake.
    <br><br>
    Previously, he appeared as a brown and amber Chinese dragon/qilin with gold accents known as the Exuvia. His outfit, Hermit of Mortal Life, is described to be his leisurewear of choice as the consultant of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.

            <p>
         If you go out for shopping with Zhongli, these are what you will face: </p>
         <figure class="rightPic"><img src="Images/A Shame.jpg" id="zhongli2"></figure>
         <p>
         He would order the whole stock of the item you are supposed to buy. ALL OF THEM. No bargaining, no second thoughts. When the happy shopkeeper is packing the the goods, you'd be wondering how rich this man is, or, just how poor you are, only to find him turn to you, and saying, "Do you...have any mora on you? I forgot to bring any"
        
         <br><br><br>And the cycle goes on.<br><br> It is always Childe who comes and saves the day by providing all the financial support for Zhongli. According to him,our delusional grandpa cannot imagine himself being poor, hence he is never concerned about mora, although he almost never has any mora with him either.</p><br><br>
         <figure class="centerPic"><img src="Images/Paimon.jpg" class="Pic"><figcaption>Paimon raising a very good question about Zhongli</figcaption></figure>
        
        Ironically, the name of the currency, Mora, is derived from the Geo Archon's name, Morax. Which makes it even funnier as to how moraless Morax is in the mortal realm.<br><br> <i>Though I haven't gone this far in the game yet, I saw a video on Youtube where he explains to the traveller why he is so broke all the time *Cute*. Then he was like, "We only spent Fatui money so it wasn't that bad of a deed" *Sheeesh XD* </i>
